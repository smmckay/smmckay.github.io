title: Building a vanilla kernel on Debian
---
The docs on the debian wiki are more than you need. `make; make
modules_install; make install` is enough to get a get a kernel you can boot.
Hooks take care of grub and initrd. It's not enough if you want kernel
headers for userspace. Use `make bindeb-pkg` for that. It creates
linux-image, linux-headers, and linux-libc-dev packages. The one limitation
is that you have to be careful with `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION` or else dpkg will
error out because of bad version syntax. Adding `-1` works, but `-io_uring`
doesn't.

I _know_ there's a very clear and detailed reason for Debian's version syntax
requirements, but...ugh. Just let me smash some garbage in there and get the
result I want. Disallow bad versions from the distro, I get that, but it
chafes when some uppity script decrees that
`5.0.0-rc3-steves-super-cool-version` is _bad_.
