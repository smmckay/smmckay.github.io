title: Building a vanilla kernel on Debian
---
The docs on the debian wiki are more than you need.

## The one-liner

`make; make modules_install; make install` in the kernel tree is enough to get
a get a kernel you can boot. Hooks take care of updating grub and initrd.
Reboot and you're on your new kernel!  It doesn't take many iterations to
figure out that's not a great solution. How are you going to remove an old
kernel? Delete files from /boot? That doesn't sound safe. If you want new
userspace headers or debug symbols as well, then it gets _really_ hairy.

## Doing it properly Use `make bindeb-pkg`. for that. It creates linux-image,
linux-image-dbg, linux-headers, and linux-libc-dev packages. The one limitation
is that you have to be careful with `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION` or else dpkg will
error out because of bad version syntax. Adding `-1` works, but `-io_uring`
doesn't.  Accept that, and you get the benefit of nice .debs integrated with
Debian's kernel machinery, including but not limited to knowing what the hell
you've done to your system and post-rm scripts.

## Griping about pedants who are not me

I _know_ there's a very clear and detailed reason for Debian's version syntax
requirements, but...ugh. Just let me smash some garbage in there and get the
result I want. Disallow bad versions from the distro, I get that, but it chafes
when some uppity script decrees that `5.0.0-rc3-steves-super-cool-version` is
_bad_.
